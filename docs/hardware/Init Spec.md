# Arbitrary Waveform Generator: System Architecture and Requirements

## System Overview

The arbitrary waveform generator is designed as a USB-powered, battery-backed device for system identification and control system analysis. Operating at frequencies up to 8 MHz with 60 dB SNR, it provides precise waveform generation through a dual-channel output system.

## Signal Chain Architecture

The signal generation path is designed around a serial interface approach, prioritizing reliability and simplicity over raw speed. This architectural choice shapes our entire signal chain, from memory management to analog output stage.

Our design philosophy emphasizes practical performance targets that align with real-world control system needs. For system identification work, timing consistency and signal quality are more critical than extremely high frequencies. Each component in our signal chain is selected with this philosophy in mind:

### Digital Signal Generation
Primary MCU requirements:
- DMA capabilities for continuous data streaming
- Hardware floating-point for mathematical operations
- Multiple high-resolution timer units
- Sufficient GPIO for parallel DAC interface
- USB peripheral with high-speed capability
- CAN peripheral for auxiliary communication

### Memory System

### Memory Strategy and Buffer Management

Our memory architecture is built around the capabilities of modern microcontrollers, taking advantage of their substantial internal RAM and efficient DMA controllers. This approach eliminates the complexity and potential signal integrity issues of external RAM while providing more than adequate performance for our needs.

Memory Requirements Analysis:
At our target 100 MSPS with 12-bit samples, our theoretical bandwidth is 1.2 Gbps per channel. However, our SPI interface serializes this data at up to 100 MHz, making the actual memory throughput requirements much more manageable. For a typical 1ms control system time step, we need only 150 KB per channel including double buffering, well within the capabilities of modern MCU internal RAM.

RAM Organization:
- Primary waveform buffer in internal MCU RAM, eliminating external memory complexity
- Double-buffering scheme for seamless output, with each buffer sized for complete control system time steps
- Buffer sizing follows: (sample_rate × bits_per_sample × channels × buffer_time)
- Typical buffer depth: 4-16K samples per channel, optimized for common control system update rates

DMA Configuration:
- Circular buffer mode for continuous output
- Interrupt on half-buffer completion
- Buffer swap without output glitches
- Error detection and recovery mechanisms

Purpose: 
- Ensuring continuous waveform generation
