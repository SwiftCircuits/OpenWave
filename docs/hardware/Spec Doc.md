# Arbitrary Waveform Generator

## System Overview

The arbitrary waveform generator represents a precision-focused instrument designed specifically for system identification and control system analysis applications. Operating at frequencies up to 500 kHz with 80 dB SNR, it delivers exceptional waveform generation through a dual-channel output system. The design philosophy emphasizes signal quality and measurement precision over raw speed, making it particularly suitable for control systems applications where signal integrity is paramount.

## Signal Chain Architecture

The signal generation path implements a carefully optimized serial interface approach, prioritizing signal integrity and reliability over raw throughput. The architecture centers around high-precision 16-bit DACs (LTC2642-16) with meticulous attention to power supply design and filtering to achieve superior signal quality.

Key architectural decisions include:
- Serial interface communication at 50 MHz
- Dual independent signal channels
- Hardware-level trigger processing
- Dedicated front panel processor for user interface
- Multi-stage filtering approach
- Temperature-compensated reference system

Our design philosophy acknowledges that most real-world control systems operate well below 500 kHz, allowing us to optimize for measurement accuracy and signal purity. Each component in the signal chain has been selected based on empirical evaluation and simulation results.
