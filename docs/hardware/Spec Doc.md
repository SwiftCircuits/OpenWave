# Arbitrary Waveform Generator

## System Overview

The arbitrary waveform generator is designed as a 12V-powered device for system identification and control system analysis. Operating at frequencies up to 8 MHz with 60 dB SNR, it provides precise waveform generation through a dual-channel output system.

## Signal Chain Architecture

The signal generation path is designed around a serial interface approach, prioritizing reliability and simplicity over raw speed. This architectural choice shapes our entire signal chain, from memory management to analog output stage.

Our design philosophy emphasizes practical performance targets that align with real-world control system needs. For system identification work, timing consistency and signal quality are more critical than extremely high frequencies. Each component in our signal chain is selected with this philosophy in mind:
## Power System Architecture

The power system implements a cascaded multi-rail design optimized for AC-powered operation through a 12V input:
