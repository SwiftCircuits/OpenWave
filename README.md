## Why OpenWave?

Traditional arbitrary waveform generators often force a choice between expensive lab equipment or limited-capability hobby projects. OpenWave bridges this gap by providing professional-grade precision in an open-source design that prioritizes signal quality over raw speed. By focusing on the critical frequency range used in control systems and system identification (up to 500 kHz), we've optimized for exceptional signal quality and reliability.

### Key Features

- Dual independent channels with 16-bit resolution
- Optimized 500 kHz bandwidth with 80 dB SNR
- Sophisticated triggering system for precise control
- Multiple interface options: USB, Ethernet, and CAN
- Intuitive front panel control with LCD display
- Expansion capability through daughter board interface
- Precision temperature-monitored reference system
- Professional-grade signal filtering and conditioning

### Perfect For
